# Multiple Exalt Clients
 Run multiple RotMG Exalt games at the same time

# How to Use
There are two ways you can run this:
- Run the `RunExalt.cmd` file, which will ask you for your login credentials.
- Create a shortcut and add ` -Username YOUR_USER -Password YOUR_PASS` to the end of the Target in the shortcut properies (right-click the shortcut and click properties).
	- If you don't want to have your password in the shortcut, you can omit the password and keep your username in there; the credential popup will show with your username already filled in.
	- You can look at `Shortcut Example` to see how it should be setup.
